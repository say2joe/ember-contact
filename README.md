ember-contact
=============

Please reimplement [this angular.js application](http://contactpath.liberlabs.com) using ember.js.  Review the templates in index.html (you're welcome to change them in any way) and add your implementation to `app.js`.

So that you don't spend more than four hours on this exercise, please note the following:

1) Validation rules may be much simpler
2) Contacts do not need to be stored in localStorage -- we can start with a fresh contact list every page load
