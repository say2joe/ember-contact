ember-contact
=============

Please reimplement [this angular.js application](http://contactpath.liberlabs.com) using ember.js.  Review the templates in `index.html` (you're welcome to change them in any way) and add your implementation to `app.js`.

So that you don't spend more than four hours on this exercise, please note the following:

1. Validation rules may be much simpler
2. Contacts do not need to be stored in localStorage -- we can start with a fresh contact list every page load
3. The loading animation has been removed
4. The relative paths have been updated to work both with and without a localhost / server address (file: works now).
